# C242-PS014 - Bangkit 2024 Batch 2 Capstone Team Project (FOSKIN)

Hello there! üëã We are a team on a mission to transform skincare with AI-driven personalized acne solutions, empowering healthier, more confident skin.

## üìë Project Overview

FOSKIN is an AI-powered mobile application designed to revolutionize skincare management, focusing specifically on acne solutions. By utilizing advanced AI detection, the app analyzes individual skin conditions and provides personalized recommendations tailored to each user's needs. FOSKIN serves as a digital skincare assistant, offering a seamless, accessible way to identify acne issues, recommend appropriate treatments, and guide users toward achieving healthier skin.

## üåç Why It Matters

Acne is a common struggle faced by millions of people around the world. For many, it‚Äôs more than just a skin issue‚Äîit affects their confidence, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life. Finding the right solution can be frustrating and overwhelming, as the causes of acne vary greatly from person to person. Generic skincare products often fail to deliver meaningful results, leaving users disheartened and uncertain about the best path forward.

This is where FOSKIN makes a difference. By harnessing the power of AI, the app goes beyond one-size-fits-all solutions, offering personalized insights tailored to each individual‚Äôs unique skin condition. No longer do users need to waste time and money on products that don‚Äôt work. Instead, they receive data-driven recommendations designed specifically for their needs, ensuring a targeted and effective approach to skincare.
